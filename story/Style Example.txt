Welcome to Storyteller!
This program implements a few different styles such as 
Typewriter printing (This is using that)
A simple console-based design
Custom story file format
And more.
>wait>2
Now, if you are like me, that last bit may have been hard to keep up with, but you may have noticed this line took a minute to show up.
>wait>1
That can be done through >wait> statements. Simply type out ">wait>" and then a number in seconds right after that, like so: >wait>1
>wait>1
Just make sure to not include a period.
>step>N
>wait>0.5
>step>O
>wait>0.5
>step>W
>wait>0.5
>break>
