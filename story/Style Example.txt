Welcome to Storyteller!
This program implements a few different styles such as 
Typewriter printing (This is using that)
A simple console-based design
Custom story file format
And more.
>wait>2
Now, if you are like me, that last bit may have been hard to keep up with, but you may have noticed this line took a minute to show up.
>wait>1
That can be done through >wait> statements. Simply type out ">wait>" and then a number in seconds right after that, like so: >wait>1
>wait>1
Just make sure to not include a period.
>step>N
>wait>0.5
>step>O
>wait>1
>step>W
>wait>0.5
>break>
You may be wondering how I spaced those letters out like that.
To answer you, that is done through >step>, >wait>, and a >break statement>
To use a step statement, simply type >step> and then type a letter right after that like so: >step>A
And, to use a break statement, which just adds a newline, simply type >break> with nothing else, like so: >break>
But then that begs the question, what am I using to type this? A >print> statement? A >write> statement. NO
To type plain text, just type it out like normal.
>break>
And there you have it. The custom story format explanation.
If you need any extra help, simply refer to this and you have it.
