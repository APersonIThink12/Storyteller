A fitting style for this program consists of many small lines that somewhat mimic a computer terminal. Somewhat like this:
Booting from drive...
>wait>2
Loaded 5 items;
>wait>1
a.txt
>wait>0.1
b.txt
>wait>0.1
c.txt
>wait>0.1
d.txt
>wait>0.1
e.txt
>wait>0.1
Please select an item:
>wait>1
>step>b
>wait>0.21
>step>.
>wait>0.34
>step>t
>wait>0.17
>step>x
>wait>0.49
>step>t
>break>
>wait>0.41
Opening b.txt...
>wait>5
And this is the stored data!
